## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Louiseâ€™s play Fever just missed her Kickstarter fundraising goal of $2,885 by only $400. She ran her campaign for 28 days between June and July. Now Louise would like to know how other campaigns faired based on their goals and launch date. In our analysis of the Kickstarter data, we will take a deeper look at Theater campaigns and determine what factors such as the time of the year that a campaign is executed, and the amount of campaign goal played in successful Kickstarter campaigns. Our goal is to provide Louise with better insights to apply to her next Kickstarter campaign in an effort to be successful in future fundraising efforts.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Looking first at the Creation Date of the Kickstarter campaigns dataset, we compared those time frames and if the campaign achieved its fundraising goal. Using a pivot table, we can quickly filter the data by Parent Category which allows us to look at all Theater projects within the data set. Now we can look at the relation of successful and failed campaigns within the context of the month they were created.

The months that not only had the most campaigns created but also the most successful ones were May and June.

To better illustrate this point, we created a chart called Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
